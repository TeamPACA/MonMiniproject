## PSEUDOCODE

Goal: <http://hot-restaurant-fsf.herokuapp.com/>

We will need:
* Servers
* Routing
* APIs
* AJAX (GET and POST Requests)

Set up server so that it displays a HTML with a homepage, reservation page and tables page
Maybe make CSS Sheet/script.js to link to server
on button press post data (logged reservations)


* Create the front-end (visuals) for home page, reservation form, and reservation views.
* Create a basic server using Express.JS
* Create a few array variables that will hold the data
* Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data
* Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages
* Use jQuery to run AJAX calls to GET and POST data from users to the Express server

Your application will be made up of two parts: 
1) A front-end set of HTML/CSS/JS pages for entering and viewing data and 
2) A back-end composed of Node/Express and basic JS for storing, updating, and relaying reservation data. An array of JSON data
